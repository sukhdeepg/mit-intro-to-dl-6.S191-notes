What is intelligence?  
The ability to process information inorder to inform some future decision or action.

What is artificial intelligence?
Practice of building artificial algorithms to do exactly the same process as above. Use data to inform future decisions.

What is machine learning?
It's a subset of AI that focuses on not explicitly programming the computer how to use that data or how to process that data but just try to learn patterns within the data to make those decisions. 

What is deep learning?
It's a subset of ML which focus on doing the above same process in ML with deep neural networks.
